# Predict-Ad-Clicks-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-XG-Boost
In this project, we will predict Ads clicks using logistic regression and XG-boost algorithms. In this project, we will assume that you have been hired as a consultant to a start-up that is running a targeted marketing ad campaign on Facebook. The company wants to analyze customer behavior by predicting which customer clicks on the advertisement.
Learning Objectives
Assess the performance of trained classifier models using various KPIs such as accuracy, precision and recall
Perform data cleaning, feature engineering and visualization
Train and test an XG-Boost and Logistic Regression models in Scikit-Learn
